## Tagging Service Copy

This repo contains a copy of the Tagging Service which was created for the OIH Platform. It should only be used for consideration of its value for inclusion in the OIH Framework.

In this service, users can create one or many Tag Groups that can be applied to other object types in the system. Under each Tag Group, Tags can then be created and specific objects may be tagged with one or many tags. (many-many relationship). 

The current implementation specifically creates the Collections Tag Group and allows for automatically removing tag associations from deleted Templates.
